## [*Prehistory of neurons*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.08.027)
Free-living marine placozoans are considered the simplest animals on Earth. Their bodies resemble a disk and consist of six to nine cell types. They move by ciliary beating, consume food particles through engulfment, and reproduce by fission. However, Najle et al. have shown that these tiny, unassuming creatures may hold the secret to the evolution of the complex nervous systems of higher animals. Placozoans do not have neurons; instead, the collective behavior of their cells is controlled by neuropeptides secreted by peptidergic cells. Detailed investigation of these cells revealed unexpected diversity in cell types and functional specificities. More surprisingly, these cells expressed many of the genes found in evolved nervous systems and differentiate from stem cells through a pathway that resembles neurogenesis in higher animals.


## [*Pregnancy and job security*](https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dead183)
Pregnancy loss is a seldom discussed public health issue that affects women and their partners’ health and wellbeing. At the population level, psychosocial stressors such as economic downturns or natural disasters can increase risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, at the individual level, the stress from becoming unemployed may also increase a woman’s risk of a stillbirth or miscarriage. Using longitudinal, representative data from 40,000 households in the UK, Di Nallo and Köksal examined the risks of job losses to pregnancy outcomes. They found that involuntary job losses of the pregnant woman or her partner increased the odds of pregnancy losses, whereas expected, non-involuntary job interruptions did not.


## [*A chain of infinities*](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202314481)
Catenanes are interlocked molecular rings akin to the linked segments in a macroscopic chain. Recent research has focused on methods to extend catenane chains to form polymeric materials. Liu et al. have now added a twist—literally—by designing ligands to curve around silver ions. They prepared chains in which the catenanes are twisted into figureeight shapes, or perhaps more appropriately, infinity symbols (∞) extending to infinity. The actual polymers are of course finite and were characterized by crystallography, absorption spectroscopy, and electron microscopy.


## [*Recreating early crust*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-023-01249-5)
The processes that created Earth’s earliest crust more than 4 billion years ago continue to be debated. Hastie et al. turned to analog experiments to better constrain the conditions under which the early crust formed. By melting material that the authors believe represents the composition of Earth’s ancient crust, they discovered that it could not form above 50 kilometers depth. To generate melts at this depth requires subduction or subduction-like processes and suggests that at least some form of plate tectonics was operating then on the early Earth.


## [*Reward expectation in fruit flies*](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2221415120)
Foraging animals need to make rapid decisions during changing conditions. Operant matching, in which choices between options are divided in proportion to the rewards received, is an ubiquitous decision- making strategy adapted to dynamically changing environments. However, little is known about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. To find out more, Rajagopalan et al. applied behavioral analysis, optogenetics, and computational modeling to the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. A foraging task was designed in which choices made by individual fruit flies could be monitored, and it confirmed that the flies’ behavior adhered to operant matching. Further, the authors found that flies’ synaptic plasticity allowed expectation of reward through the protocerebral anterior medial dopaminergic neurons.


## [*Reservoir bones*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-023-01240-7)
Within bone marrow, blood vessel endothelial cells can secrete factors that are required for bone homeostasis and hematopoiesis. While surveying the taxonomy of bone marrow cells by single-cell RNA sequencing, Iga et al. identified a distinctive, and previously unknown, subtype of capillary endothelial cell within the femurs of mice. These were located specifically at the epiphyseal region of the long bone, a section mostly ignored when analyzing the constituents of bone marrow. In addition to producing type I collagens that strengthen bones, the epithelial cells may also form a niche for hematopoietic stem cells.


## [*Imaging by ray shifting not bending*](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.031039)
Imaging objects with conventionally shaped glass lenses or thinner versions in the form of metalenses comprising engineered arrays of subwavelength resonators both produce an inverted image. Each method works on the premise of bending light waves, so precise alignment of imaging components is required to produce a sharp, upright image. Liu et al. describe an ultrathin reciprocal lens in which imaging is based on laterally shifting the light rays rather than bending them. Demonstrating the principle in a photonic crystal slab, the single reciprocal lens eliminates the need for alignment to produce an upright image. The rayshifting mechanism provides an alternate route for the development of optical components for imaging and wavefront shaping.

## [*Controlling spin-waves with a superconductor*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj7576)
The ability to control spin and charge transport on a chip has revolutionized information technology. For spintronics, the collective spin excitations of magnetic materials, known as spin-waves, have emerged as a promising platform that can offer new functionalities because of their wave nature. However, control of the spin-waves has remained a formidable challenge. Borst et al. show that the diamagnetism of a superconductor can be used to shape the magnetic environment that governs the transport of spin-waves in a magnetic thin film. Magnetic imaging showed how the diamagnetism leads to spin-waves with strongly altered, temperaturetunable wavelengths. Control of spin-wave transport using the diamagnetic response of a superconducting gate will be important for developing device applications.


## [*Initiating the Casparian strip*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi5032)
Plant roots contain a ligninbased diffusion barrier called the Casparian strip that controls nutrient balance. Gao et al. found that a family of dirigent proteins controls the synthesis of lignin at the Casparian strip. The authors established a two-stage process of synthesis in which the dirigent proteins initiate lignin biosynthesis in plasma membrane patches. After this, gaps between the patches are filled in by the previously described Schengen pathway. The work extends our understanding of complex polysaccharide patterning in the plant extracellular space.


## [*Translation-dependent IL-17 generation*](https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abo6555)
Interleukin-17 (IL-17)–producing CD4+ helper T (TH17) cells mediate chronic inflammation in autoimmune diseases. Revu et al. uncovered a nuclear role for the phospholipid PIP2 in IL-17 production by TH17 cells. During the differentiation of human naïve CD4+ T cells into TH17 cells in vitro, PIP2 was enriched in nuclei in a manner dependent on the kinase PIP5K1α. Nuclear PIP2 facilitated the translation of IL17A mRNA and IL-17 protein production. CD4+ T cells from multiple sclerosis patients treated with a PIP5K1α inhibitor secreted less IL-17A than untreated cells.


## [*Electron-induced lattice softening*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf3348)
In solid state materials, changes in the crystal lattice are often accompanied by changes in the electronic system. Whether the lattice or the electrons is the primary driver of a transition may, however, be difficult to ascertain. Noad et al. measured the Young’s modulus in the extremely clean material Sr2RuO4 as it underwent an electronic (Lifshitz) transition. The researchers found a large drop in the Young’s modulus at the transition, suggesting that conduction electrons drive a nonlinear elastic response in this material.


## [*Metal switch expands activity*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adh5339)
DNA polymerases, like most enzymes, are specific for their native substrates, deoxyribonucleotides, and have carefully tuned active site chemistry that can be challenging to adapt. Lelyveld et al. performed time-resolved x-ray crystallography on a DNA polymerase variant that accepts a 3'-amino sugar, catalyzing the formation of phosphoramidate linkages instead of the natural phosphodiester bonds. They found that the two metal ions responsible for catalysis in the native enzyme were disrupted, and only a single divalent metal ion was involved in catalysis in this variant enzyme. The authors used this insight to propose trivalent rare earth metal ions as an alternative cofactor. The addition of scandium(III) yielded the most proficient phosphoramidate. DNA polymerase variant.


## [*Decoding human gut endocrine cell fate*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi2246)
Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) reside in the epithelium of the digestive tract and produce various hormones involved in metabolism. The generation of different EEC lineages is governed by a dedicated network of transcription factors. However, given the low efficiency of EEC specification from adult stem cells, it has been difficult to elucidate the components of this regulatory network. Lin et al. used an optimized human small intestinal organoid culture system to perform an unbiased, systematic screen for transcription factors that regulate EEC differentiation. The screen implicated ZNF800 as a key factor exerting a dominant repressive role in controlling the endocrine transcription factor network. This work showcases the use of optimized human organoids for CRISPR-based functional screens, paving the way for the identification of additional regulators in human gut physiology and pathophysiology.


## [*Unraveling congenital ZIKV syndrome*](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adh0043)
Pregnant women infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) can vertically transmit the virus to their fetuses, and this has been linked to congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS). Understanding how ZIKV infection affects prenatal and neonatal development is critical for human health. Saron et al. and Moadab et al. used cynomolgus and rhesus macaque models, respectively, to understand how maternal ZIKV infection influences fetal development. Saron et al. found that preexisting immunity to dengue virus, a related flavivirus, worsened the severity of CZS. Moadab et al. found that maternal ZIKV infection alone was sufficient to reduce infant size and affect social behaviors. Together, these studies shed light on the impacts of ZIKV infection on fetal and early life development.


## [*Toward one-step gene editing*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi3183)
Programmable DNA targeting has improved rapidly over the past decade, primarily as a result of the development of CRISPR-Cas systems, which allow precise cleavage of target sequences. However, this approach relies on cellular DNA repair pathways for the subsequent gene-editing step, which introduces heterogeneity that represents a safety concern. In a Perspective, Tang and Sternberg propose retroelement-based gene editing as a safer alternative to CRISPR-Cas approaches. Retroelements are endogenous DNA segments that use the host cell’s RNA polymerase to generate an RNA copy of themselves, which is then turned into complementary DNA by a reverse transcriptase and incorporated into the genome elsewhere. Recent studies have provided information on the mechanisms underlying this process and raise the hope that they can be exploited for programmable DNA targeting in the future.


## [*Another menopausal primate*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add5473)
Menopause occurs in all known human societies; however, it is not common to all mammals and has so far only been observed in humans and a few toothed whale species. Wood et al. looked at demographic and endocrine data in a long-studied population of chimpanzees in Uganda and found clear evidence for menopause in females living past the age of 50 (see the Perspective by Cant). Unlike the case for humans and toothed whales, however, postreproductive chimps in this population are not involved in the raising of related offspring, suggesting that a different process is driving its development.


## [*Concept cells in nonhuman primates*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf0460)
There are numerous animal studies showing that single neurons encode the identity of conspecifics from social signals in different sensory modalities such as olfaction, vision, or audition. However, there has been no demonstration in a nonhuman animal that these unimodal signals are integrated into a cohesive cross-modal representation of individual identity. Tyree et al. performed single-neuronal recordings in marmosets presented with pictures and sounds from conspecifics (see the Perspective by Wirth). A subpopulation of neurons responded selectively to both the face and voice of individual animals, much like concept neurons in the human medial temporal lobe. Furthermore, animal identity could be successfully decoded from the neuronal population activity, along with aspects of social relationships such as being a family member.


## [*Stabilizing frequency combs*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj3858)
The generation of stable and controllable optical frequency combs has important implications for applications in metrology and precision spectroscopy. Heckelmann et al. propose and demonstrate a quantum walk laser in synthetic frequency space (see the Perspective by Corrielli). The technique allows for the development of a frequency comb laser based on a coherent walk in frequency space combined with a fast-gain medium. Also applicable to optical wavelengths, the approach provides a flexible route to generating stable and broadband frequency combs across a range of wavelengths for precision sensing and communication applications.


## [*Enriching alcohols coming and going*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj0040)
Asymmetric catalysis generally relies on biasing a single step in a reaction to favor one of two possible mirror-image products. This approach places a high premium on ligand optimization. Wen et al. report a light-driven deracemization of alcohols in which a single chiral titanium catalyst differentiates stereochemistry in both a photoinitiated bond cleavage step and a subsequent bond reformation step (see the Perspective by Kim and Sarpong). Neither step alone is exceptionally selective, but the cumulative combination leads to enantiomeric ratios ranging from 90:10 to 99:1 across a variety of substrates.


## [*The dynamics of an unusual transition*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abq6753)
Cooling two-dimensional many-body systems to low temperatures causes them to undergo the so-called Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition to a superfluid phase. The BKT transition differs from the more conventional ones in three dimensions, and although it has been studied extensively for equilibrium systems, its dynamic version is relatively unexplored. Sunami et al. studied the dynamics of a two-dimensional Bose gas of rubidium atoms after a quench across the BKT transition. To create the quench, the researchers split the superfluid gas in half, causing each half to undergo a transition to the normal phase. Matter-wave interferometry revealed universal scaling laws in accordance with theory.


## [*A fine-tuned balance*](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.adh1306)
Intratumoral exhausted CD8+ stem- or progenitor-like T cell (Tprog) and terminally differentiated T cells (Tterm) mediate antitumor immunity and response to immunotherapy. Sun et al. investigated how exhausted CD8+ T cells are transcriptionally regulated in murine tumor models, finding that the transcription factors BCL6 and BLIMP1 reciprocally regulate T cell fates. BCL6 promoted the long-term persistence of Tprog cells in response to TGF-β–SMAD2 signaling by repressing the Tterm transcriptional program. Conversely, interleukin-2–STAT5 signaling repressed BCL6, resulting in BLIMP1 transcription and subsequent Tterm differentiation. These findings identify a regulatory network that controls CD8+ T cell exhaustion in cancer, which could be targeted to alter the balance of Tprog and Tterm cells and improve responses to immunotherapy.
